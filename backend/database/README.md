# ZOG Store Database Schema

## Database Schema Overview

The application uses MySQL with the following main tables:

- users - User accounts and authentication
- games - Game catalog with details and pricing
- inventory - Stock quantities for each game
- cart - User shopping cart items
- orders - Order information and status
- order_items - Items within each order
- payments - Payment information for orders

## Detailed Schema Explanation

The database schema is designed to support a complete e-commerce flow for game purchases:

### Tables and Their Relationships

1. **users**

   - Primary fields: `user_id` (PK), `username`, `email`, `password`, `created_at`, `role`
   - This table stores all user account information
   - The `role` field distinguishes between regular users and administrators
   - Has one-to-many relationships with orders and cart items

2. **games**

   - Primary fields: `game_id` (PK), `title`, `description`, `price`, `platform`, `genre`, `gameicon`, `created_at`, `is_deleted`
   - Stores all information about games available in the store
   - Connected to multiple tables: cart, inventory, and order_items
   - The `is_deleted` field allows for soft deletion (hiding games without removing their data)

3. **inventory**

   - Primary fields: `inventory_id` (PK), `game_id` (FK), `stock_quantity`
   - Tracks the current stock level for each game
   - One-to-one relationship with games (each game has exactly one inventory entry)

4. **cart**

   - Primary fields: `cart_id` (PK), `user_id` (FK), `game_id` (FK), `quantity`
   - Temporarily stores items that users have added to their shopping cart
   - Many-to-one relationships with both users and games

5. **orders**

   - Primary fields: `order_id` (PK), `user_id` (FK), `order_date`, `total_amount`, `status`
   - Stores the header information for customer orders
   - One-to-many relationship with order_items and payments
   - Many-to-one relationship with users

6. **order_items**

   - Primary fields: `order_item_id` (PK), `order_id` (FK), `game_id` (FK), `quantity`
   - Junction table that stores individual items within each order
   - Many-to-one relationships with orders and games

7. **payments**
   - Primary fields: `payment_id` (PK), `order_id` (FK), `payment_date`, `payment_method`
   - Stores payment information for each order
   - Many-to-one relationship with orders

### How Data Flows Through the System

When a user interacts with the ZOG Store, here's how data flows through these tables:

1. **User Registration and Login**

   - When a user signs up, their information is stored in the `users` table
   - Authentication checks credentials against this table

2. **Browsing Games**

   - Game information is fetched from the `games` table
   - Available stock is checked in the `inventory` table

3. **Adding Items to Cart**

   - When a user adds a game to their cart, a new record is created in the `cart` table
   - The record contains the user_id, game_id, and quantity
   - Before adding, the system checks the `inventory` table to ensure sufficient stock

4. **Checkout Process**

   - When a user proceeds to checkout:
     1. A new record is created in the `orders` table with order details
     2. Records from the user's cart are copied to the `order_items` table with the new order_id
     3. Stock quantities in the `inventory` table are reduced accordingly
     4. Payment information is stored in the `payments` table
     5. The user's cart items are cleared from the `cart` table

5. **Order Management**

   - Admin users can update order status through the `orders` table
   - The system can track orders through different states: pending, processing, shipped, delivered, or canceled

6. **Inventory Management**
   - When new games are added, inventory records are created
   - Admin users can update stock quantities in the `inventory` table

### Data Constraints and Integrity

The schema enforces several important constraints:

1. **Foreign Key Constraints**

   - Ensures referential integrity (e.g., you can't have an order item for a non-existent game)
   - Prevents orphaned records when related records are deleted

2. **Deletion Rules**

   - Games with active cart entries or orders can't be hard-deleted
   - Users with existing orders can't be deleted
   - When deleting orders, related records in `order_items` and `payments` are also deleted

3. **Soft Deletion**
   - Games use soft deletion (setting `is_deleted` flag to TRUE) instead of being removed from the database
   - This preserves order history integrity while hiding discontinued games from the storefront

### Database Triggers

The database implements several automatic triggers to maintain data integrity and automate common operations:

1. **decrease_inventory_after_order**

   - Triggers: AFTER INSERT ON `order_items`
   - Function: Automatically decreases the inventory stock quantity when a new order item is created
   - Implementation:
     ```sql
     UPDATE inventory
     SET stock_quantity = stock_quantity - NEW.quantity
     WHERE game_id = NEW.game_id;
     ```
   - Purpose: Ensures inventory is immediately updated when items are purchased

2. **clear_cart_after_order**
   - Triggers: AFTER INSERT ON `orders`
   - Function: Automatically clears a user's cart after they complete an order
   - Implementation:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM cart
     WHERE user_id = NEW.user_id;
     ```
   - Purpose: Prevents duplicate purchases and maintains a clean shopping experience

These triggers help maintain data consistency and automate workflows within the application, reducing the need for manual intervention and preventing common data integrity issues.
